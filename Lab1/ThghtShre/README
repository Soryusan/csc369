TO COMPILE:
   A makefile is included, the "make" command should compile the program

TO RUN:
   In order to run, use "make runTS”

INPUT:
   When the program is executed, it will ask for the filename of the output file.
   Once this is entered, it will then ask for the number of JSON objects to generate.
   Lastly, it will ask for a word file for message generation. Input any txt file, else input “sense.txt”.


COMMENTS:
   1. For public messages, to generate mostly “subscribers” and “all” evenly, 
      we added more number rolls to them (4 number rolls each). 
      As for self/userId, we only did 1 roll (1/9 ~= 11.11%) to keep it under 20%.
   
   2. For protected messages, to generate mainly “subscribers’, we added
      more number rolls to it (4 number rolls). 
      As for self/userId, we only did 1 roll (1/5 = 20%).

   3. For private message, they are only addressed to userId. Since we use a random
      generator for the selected user, chances of userId is equal to the author of the message
      is 1/10000.
